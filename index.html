<h2>What is AltValues?</h2>
<p>AltValues (1.0.0) is a political quiz, running on a modded base of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a>, that attempts to assign you percentages across multiple axes <del>with a label of what you might be</del>. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
  <p>There are currently nine axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p><br/>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#009999;">Individualism</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#DA0000;">Collectivism</b><br/>
        Those with higher Individualism score emphasize personal achievement regardless of the expense of group goals, resulting in a strong sense of competition. Those with higher Collectivism score emphasize family and work group goals above individual needs or desires.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#048CF4;">Market</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FF4900;">Planned</b><br/>
        Those with higher Market score support laissez-faire market system as an efficient way to redistribute resources. Those with higher Planned score see free markets as unfairly flawed and support alternative system(s), such as a (state-)planned economy.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00CC00;">Essentialism</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#CD0074;">Constructivism</b><br/>
        Those with higher Essentialism score consider that all people have a set of inherent traits, regardless of environmental factors. Those with higher Constructivism score consider the characteristics of a person to be influenced by the environment (socio-economic factors, upbringing).</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#A101B3;">Pragmatism</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#6AB001;">Idealism</b><br/>
        Those with higher Pragmatism score value practical solution, with no concerns over moral dogmas. Those with higher Idealism score tend to adapt a set of moral principles for life and reject challenging views, even if proven superior.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#048CF4;">Universalism</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FFBF00;">Particularism</b><br/>
        Those with higher Universalism score see their worldview as adaptable everywhere. Those with higher Particularism score see their worldview as limited to their context and region.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00CC00;">Ecology</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FF7400;">Industrial</b><br/>
        Those with higher Ecology score have higher concerns over nature and are willing to sacrifice industrial output to preserve nature. Those with higher Industrial score have little regards to environmental concerns and value industrial output over nature.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#009999;">Politicized</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#808080;">Apolitical</b><br/>
        Those with higher Politicized score see politics as important aspect of everyday life (mandated political organizations, ideological advertising). Those with higher Apolitical score think that if there are any politics, it should be dealt with out of their sight. They just want to grill, for god's sake!</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FFBF00;">Religious</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#A600A6;">Secular</b><br/>
        Those with higher Religious score see religion as an important aspect of society. Those with higher Secular score would rather not have religious affairs in society.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#074FF5;">Futuristic</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FF7400;">Historic</b><br/>
        Those with higher Futuristic score prefer futurist (space, acceleration, technology, youth) aesthetics. Those with higher Historic score prefer historic (godly, mighty, strong, ideal) aesthetics.</p>
<h3>What is "Closest Match" in the results?</h3>
    <p>Like 8values, this quiz tries to match you with an ideology. This is highly W.I.P and will get more accurate as more people answer (honestly).</p>
